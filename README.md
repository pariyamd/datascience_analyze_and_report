# datascience_analyze_and_report
some data science projects in R, including reports in markdown format, codes, output plots &amp; models.
## This repo includes three of my datascience projects:

### A Passage on Literature
this report includes questions about charles dickens' books & novels.
1. most used top 20 words in dickens’ books
2. wordcloud of dickens’ books
3. five most used names in dickens’ books

5. most used verbs for men and women in dickens’ books
6. unigram vs bigram distributions per chapter/ per book
7. unigram, bigram distributions comparison between austins' and dickens' novels


### Murder or Death
this data is death records from 90's to 2017
in this report i've illustrated some of the features to better understand the data:
1. correlation of main attributes
2. ratio of murder/suicide based on race, sex, age and education.

Then I've trained a Generalized linear model using H2o and plotted the False Positives and False negatives overally and detailed( based on race and sex ).
and then some plots are drawn for better understanding the model such as DOC or acc/threshold.
then i try to tune the depth of model and based on the best depth i tune other parameters.
this model is later used in a shiny app to help judges better predict wheather a death was caused by a murder or suicide

1. top mobile device manufacturers
